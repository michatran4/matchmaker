    "# Spectrum Analysis\r\n",
    "Answers will be laid out on a spectrum, and this will allow for some easy math. This approach works because if a question has only two choices, then it implies that the two choices are polar opposites of each other. This will be perfectly represented with a large difference of 1 between adjacent choices. However, a question with one hundred choices will have less of an impact, as differences between adjacent choices will only be 0.01."
